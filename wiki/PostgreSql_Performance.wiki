To get a definitve answer on how much time is spent in database 
processing, set log_min_duration_statement to 0 (default is -1 = 
disabled) in your postgresql.conf, kill -HUP the database, and re-run 
your request. You'll get durations for every single statement. It is 
very easy to overlook a performance killer here. If you find a statement 
that takes seconds, run an "explain" on it to make sure it uses an 
index, or create an appropriate index if it doesn't.
